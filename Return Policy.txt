Return & Quality Guarantee Policy

ஸ்ரீ கிருஷ்ணா பர்னிச்சர்ஸ் (Shree Krishna Furnitures), Mambakkam


Commitment to Craftsmanship
Our reputation is built on delivering high-durability furniture engineered to last 10-12 years. Because every piece is custom-made to individual specifications, all sales are considered final. We have strict policies regarding returns to manage customer expectations and maintain our operational efficiency as a micro-business.

1. All Sales Are Final (No Returns/Exchanges)

Due to the custom nature of our made-to-order business model, we do not accept returns, exchanges, or order cancellations.

2. Mandatory Factory Inspection & Acceptance

To ensure complete satisfaction, we require the customer to personally inspect the finished product at our Mambakkam factory before it leaves the premises.

By accepting the product and arranging its transport, you are confirming that the product is free of major defects and matches the agreed-upon specifications.

3. Post-Pickup Support & Guarantee

We stand behind our craftsmanship and ensure that our products are installed correctly:

Craftsmanship Issues: If a verified structural issue (not caused by transit damage) becomes apparent during or immediately after our on-site assembly, we will fix it at your location free of charge.

Transit/Customer Damage: We are not liable for any damage that occurs during customer-arranged transportation or general negligence at the customer's location. We offer repair services for such instances at a reasonable material and labor charge.
